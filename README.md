# akDonationTracker
This project is built as a Bukkit plugin for use on the Arisen Kingdom RPG server. The aim is to keep track of how much each 
player has donated in total to be able to rank and display this information. It provides a simple command that when connected 
to the enjin-system, allows the donation to be tallied against the user's account.
